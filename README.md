Bye, Felicia.
=============

Turns out I couldn't find a Twitter bot that took the best lines from the movie "Friday" and tweeted them on Fridays.

So I made one.

Helps that this particular movie is the source of years' worth of inside jokes with one of my best friends. So as much as I did this for me, I did this for him.
